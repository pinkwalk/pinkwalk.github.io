            <p class="lead">As Cotiviti Care strive to raise awareness about cancer, we have initiated preparations for an event
                named
                the
                "PinkWalk." This event is being organized in partnership with Cancer Care Nepal, a non-profit,
                non-governmental organization established in 2065. The primary focus of this Walkathon, particularly
                about
                breast cancer awareness, is to elevate understanding of the disease, promote early detection, foster a
                sense
                of community among those affected, and generate funding for research, treatment, and support.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The objective of a Walkathon for breast cancer awareness is to raise awareness about breast
                    cancer, promote early detection, support individuals affected by the disease, and raise funds for
                    research,
                    treatment, and support services. Specifically, the objectives of a Walkathon for breast cancer
                    awareness
                    include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Raise Awareness</strong>: The Walkathon aims to educate the community about breast
                        cancer,
                        its
                        signs
                        and symptoms, risk factors, and the importance of early detection through regular screenings
                        and self-examinations. By increasing awareness, the event seeks to empower individuals to take
                        proactive measures for their breast health.

                    <li><strong>Promote Early Detection and Screening</strong>: The Walkathon emphasizes the importance

                        early
                        detection and regular breast cancer screenings, such as mammograms. It aims to motivate
                        individuals to schedule screenings, educate them about available resources and support
                        services, and encourage proactive healthcare practices for breast cancer prevention and
                        detection.

                        participation,
                        fostering a sense of unity and solidarity among participants. It provides an opportunity for
                        individuals, families, friends, and local organizations to come together, show support, and
                        actively contribute to the cause. The event promotes community engagement and collaboration
                        to combat breast cancer collectively.
