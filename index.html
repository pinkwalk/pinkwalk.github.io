        <p><strong>PinkWalk</strong> is a breast cancer awareness and fundraising initiative orchestrated by Cotiviti
            Nepal's CSR team, in collaboration with Cancer Care Nepal. This event serves a dual purpose by raising
            awareness about breast cancer while also generating funds to support the cause.</p>
        <p>The donations received will be channeled towards Cancer Care Nepal. Cancer Care Nepal will leverage these
            contributions to provide essential breast cancer treatment services to individuals facing economic
            hardships, ensuring that they receive the care and support they urgently need.</p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective of a PinkWalk for breast cancer awareness is to raise awareness about breast
            cancer, promote early detection, support individuals affected by the disease, and raise funds for
            research, treatment, and support services. Specifically, the objectives of a Walkathon for breast cancer
            awareness include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Raise Awareness</strong>: The Walkathon aims to educate the community about breast cancer, its
                signs and symptoms, risk factors, and the importance of early detection through regular screenings
                and self-examinations. By increasing awareness, the event seeks to empower individuals to take
                proactive measures for their breast health.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Promote Early Detection and Screening</strong>: The Walkathon emphasizes the importance of early
                detection and regular breast cancer screenings, such as mammograms. It aims to motivate
                individuals to schedule screenings, educate them about available resources and support
                services, and encourage proactive healthcare practices for breast cancer prevention and
                detection.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Community Engagement and Support</strong>: The Walkathon encourages community
                participation, fostering a sense of unity and solidarity among participants. It provides an opportunity
                for individuals, families, friends, and local organizations to come together, show support, and
                actively contribute to the cause. The event promotes community engagement and collaboration
                to combat breast cancer collectively.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Support life after cancer</strong>: By organizing a Walkathon for breast cancer
                awareness, the event seeks to make a significant impact in raising awareness, promoting early detection,
                supporting those affected by breast cancer, and generating funds for vital research and services. The
                ultimate objective is to reduce the burden of breast cancer, improve outcomes, and work
                towards a future free from the disease.
